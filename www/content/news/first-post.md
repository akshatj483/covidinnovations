Dear all,

Thanks to the generous support from a donor, we have received $2k of funding for our non-profit website. 

We are thus looking for a community manager that can help us coordinate the reachout for our platform. We can compensate you for your time with $1.5k to $2k USD. 

We are looking for someone as close to fulltime as possible. You should understand the project and belive in it. The responsibilities would involve
* Reaching out to tech communities for diffusion of the platform to COVID solution givers
* Reaching out to news outlets (theverge, newspaper, etc) to get the platform to be known
* Reaching out to donors and charities to get government grants: With new funding, we can increase your own salary and hire more help
* Reach out to health organizations around the world to get their interest in our database (and maybe support it)
* Coordinate volunteers who reach out to us, and assign them tasks for the above. 

It is a plus if you have on of the below: 
* worked for non-profits before
* have experience in fundraising
* have a network in technology communities
* have an understandin of government procurement 

Please reach out to basile@blockdynamics.io if interested. Thank you !
