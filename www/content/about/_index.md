Covid Tenders is a non-profit initiative launched by a group of volunteers. It was started by [Basile
Verhulst](https://www.linkedin.com/in/basile-verhulst-a258a46b/) who has founded several high-tech
startups in Asia and Paris in the past.

It is an initiative launched and supported by the [French Tech Community in Asia](
https://hk.lafrenchtech.com/). La French Tech is a unique movement bringing together startups,
investors, policymakers and community builders to foster the growth of the startup ecosystem in
France and across the world.

We are committed to slow down the spread of the virus and save lives by accelerating the
technological innovation against the Coronavirus.
