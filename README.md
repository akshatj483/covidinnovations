# Covid Innovations

Thank you for joining our COVID Open Innovation Database. We want to facilitate the exchange of technology by opening up an open, public database of COVID-19 innovations. Suppliers of tech solutions can directly post their details online, and be openly searched and browsed by anyone who has a demand, in a peer-to-peer fashion.
